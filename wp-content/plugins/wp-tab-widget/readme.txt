== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Plugin is not working =

Please disable all plugins and check if shortcode plugin is working properly. Then you can enable all plugins one by one to find out which plugin is conflicting with plugin.

= Plugins is consuming too much resources =

The pageview is incremented on the database everytime a user visits a page but this can start getting quite expensive on high-traffic websites. We've added the filter `wpt_sampling_rate` which you can use to lower the sampling rate from the default <strong>100%</strong>. Note that setting this value too low will result to innacurate pageviews.

`
<?php

function wpt_my_sampling_rate( $rate ) {
    // Reduce the percentage of pageviews recorded to 80%.
    return 80;
}
add_filter( 'wpt_sampling_rate', 'wpt_my_sampling_rate' );
